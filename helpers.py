    Industrial Intelligence pages built on analytics.py's pooled per-grade
    pipeline (Trend Analysis, Machine Settings vs Physical Properties
    Correlation, Machine Settings Optimization) - added 2026-08-02 so a
    reviewer can pool an entire product family's grades into one analysis
    instead of checking each grade one at a time. Recipe Optimization and
    Root-Cause Assistant don't use this: their sections (current
    formulation/cost, version diff, run-vs-prior-run diff) are inherently
    about one specific grade, not something that pools sensibly.

    `grades` must be the CALLER's already-scoped-and-filtered list of
    FoamGrade objects (e.g. already restricted to grades with quality test
    results) - foam families are derived from this same list via groupby,
    so a family only ever offers the grades that already passed the
    caller's own filter, and "Foam family X" never silently pulls in a
    grade that "Foam grade" mode wouldn't have offered on its own.

    Returns a dict:
    - mode: "grade" or "family"
    - label: display name (grade_name, or the family's name)
    - grade_ids: list of foam_grade_id(s) to pass into analytics.py

      (see expert_note_plant_id_for_link/expert_note_link_label above)
    - entity_id: the grade's or family's own id, paired with link_type
    - state_key: unique string for namespacing st.session_state keys across
      grade/family selections (e.g. "grade-14" vs "family-3") so switching
      between them doesn't show a stale cached PI3 answer from the other mode
    - member_grade_names: sorted list of grade_name strings included in
