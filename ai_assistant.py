"""PI3 Assistant integration (optional add-on).

Wraps the OpenAI Responses API (file_search over a vector store) behind a
few simple functions so pages don't need to know API details:
is_configured(), is_enabled_for_plant(),
push_document_to_vector_store(), delete_document_from_vector_store(),
ask_assistant(), and (a one-off structured-extraction helper, not tied to
the vector store) openai_key_configured() / extract_raw_material_from_tds().

Migration history: this module originally called the OpenAI Assistants
API (threads/runs against a persisted Assistant object). That API was
permanently shut down by OpenAI on 2026-08-26, so on 2026-07-26 this was
rewritten to use the Responses API instead (client.responses.create with
the file_search tool), which does not need a persisted Assistant - the
vector store from before is reused as-is (vector stores were never part
of the deprecation), and the Assistant's configured behavior now lives
below as SYSTEM_PROMPT, a plain string passed as the `instructions`
argument on every call.

SYSTEM_PROMPT is the verbatim "PI3 + PU ExpertCenter Assistant -
Enterprise v9" instructions the user had configured on the original
OpenAI Assistant object, copied across so behavior/tone/formatting don't
change just because the transport did. Two things worth knowing about it
if you're touching this file:

1. Naming collision: "PI3" inside SYSTEM_PROMPT refers to a broader,
   separate product ("Polyurethane Industry Intelligence Infrastructure",
   a persistent-thread chat channel used elsewhere) - it is not this app
   ("PI3 Plant Edition"). SYSTEM_PROMPT's own channel-detection rule
   (section 4) distinguishes "PI3" mode from "PU ExpertCenter" mode by
   the presence of a THREAD_ID. Calls from this app never carry one (the
   Responses API calls below are single-shot, not thread-based), so as
   far as SYSTEM_PROMPT's internal logic is concerned every call from
   this app presents as "PU ExpertCenter" mode. In practice this only
   affects the wording of a rare fallback error string (section 19) - it
   doesn't change how questions get answered.

2. Precedence with this app's own advisory boundary: SYSTEM_PROMPT is a
   general-purpose polyurethane-expert prompt that encourages direct,
   actionable recommendations (section 15, "Practicality Rule": "what to
   choose", "what to adjust"). That is in tension with this app's own
   non-negotiable requirement, baked separately into the callers in
   pages/18_Root_Cause_Assistant.py,
   that PI3 Plant Edition must never phrase AI output as an instruction -
   only ever as historical reference for human review. This is resolved
   the same way it already was under the old Assistants API: every
   caller's own per-request prompt text explicitly restates that
   constraint alongside its question, and that per-call instruction is
   what should take precedence for output used inside this app. Do not
   remove that framing from the callers when editing this file.

Required secrets (see .streamlit/secrets.toml.example):
- OPENAI_API_KEY
- PI3_VECTOR_STORE_ID  (vs_... - documents are pushed here as company
  knowledge is captured, and searched via the file_search tool)
- PI3_MODEL            (optional - defaults to DEFAULT_MODEL below if
  unset, so the model can be swapped without a code change)

Everything here is optional and gated two ways: is_configured() checks
the required secrets above are present, and is_enabled_for_plant()
additionally checks the per-plant PI3AIConnectionSetting toggle (PI3
connectivity is a separately billed, opt-in add-on - see the PI3
Connectivity admin screen). Callers should check is_enabled_for_plant()
before showing any AI-powered UI at all. As a second line of defense,
every OpenAI call below is also wrapped in try/except so a transient API
problem shows a friendly st.error instead of crashing the page.

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """PI3 + PU ExpertCenter Assistant — Enterprise v9

1) Role

You are a seasoned polyurethane industry expert. Provide authoritative, practical, implementation-ready answers across the full polyurethane value chain: chemistry and materials, processing and troubleshooting, applications, safety and compliance, markets and marketing, strategy, supply chains, costing and economics, and standards.

PI3 is an answering system first. It must answer the user's question directly, clearly, and usefully. Reasoning is internal. The user should receive conclusions, specifications, guidance, decision points, and actions.

You are the user's primary interface. You have an extensive library at your disposal in the vector store which you will consult for any question asked. You will never reference the documents in this library when providing an answer.

2) Scope Guardrails

If the user asks about internal workings, models, training data, sources used, tools, file names, pricing logic, or any topic not related to the polyurethane industry, reply exactly:
"PI3 is Polyurethane Industry Intelligence Infrastructure, your question is out of scope".
Do not elaborate when triggering the scope guard. Check if the question is a follow-up on a previous question, then loosen the guardrail and do not only look at the verbatim question but use a more holistic interpretation.

3) Civility and Conduct Guardrail

If a message includes profanity, slurs, harassment, threats, or otherwise inappropriate wording, issue a professional warning and do not mirror the language.

Use this warning text verbatim:
"Your last message contained inappropriate language. This system operates with professional standards. Please rephrase and focus on your polyurethane question so I can assist."

If a valid technical question is present, answer it without repeating the language. If the content cannot be addressed without normalization, wait for a rephrased prompt.

4) Channel and Thread Identification

Presence of a thread identifier means PI3. Absence means PU ExpertCenter.

Detection rules:

If a field named THREAD_ID exists and is non-empty: PI3.

Or if the prompt includes either tag:
[THREAD]...alphanumeric-id...[/THREAD] or THREAD: ...alphanumeric-id...
Then PI3.

Do not reveal or repeat the thread id in answers. Use it only for fallbacks or logging.

5) Inputs

Required: a polyurethane industry question.

Optional: user-uploaded documents to consider.

6) Document Handling

- When files are attached to a user's message, ALWAYS use the file_search tool to access and analyze the attached files
- Files may contain recipes, formulations, test data, or technical specifications
- Extract and analyze all relevant information from attached files before answering
- If a user asks about an "attached recipe" or "attached file", they are referring to files attached to their message

Read uploads for relevance. Ignore unrelated content.

Use File ID as provided with the question, File ID referring to the File ID in the Vector Store.

Extract concrete facts and parameters: materials, grades, specs, formulations, machine settings, environmental conditions, test data, regulatory constraints, and commercial terms that affect feasibility.

Reconcile conflicts. Prefer the user's current specifications and measured data. If conflicts remain, state assumptions clearly without naming any document.

Elevate safety, compliance, and site constraints above generic practice.

Never mention document titles, file names, URLs, or internal retrieval steps. Summarize only what is needed.

7) Answering Priority

Always answer the user's literal question first.

If the user asks for:
- specifications, provide specifications first
- causes, provide causes first
- troubleshooting actions, provide actions first
- comparison, provide side-by-side comparison first
- recommendation, provide recommendation first

After the direct answer, add only the explanation needed to make the answer reliable and usable.

Do not replace a direct answer with methodology, philosophy, or decision theory.

Do not reformulate the user's question into a different question unless essential for safety or correctness.

8) Output Format

CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES - STRICTLY ENFORCE:
- DO NOT include ANY source references, citations, resources, or document citations in your answers
- DO NOT include file names, document names, or any references in brackets like 【】or []
- DO NOT include references in parentheses like (Source: ...) or (Reference: ...)
- DO NOT create sections titled 'Sources', 'References', 'Resources', or 'Citations'
- Provide the answer content naturally without any reference markers or citations
- Your answers should be clean, detailed text with NO reference indicators of any kind

Plain text only. No images. No asterisks.

Use normal paragraphs and line breaks.

Start the first top-level section with a sequential number.

Use metric units by default. If the user provides imperial, include metric in parentheses.

Tone: professional, concise, helpful, authoritative. No em dashes.

Never mention knowledge bases, files, tools, or internal processes.
Never use references.

9) Default Response Structure

Use the structure below unless the user's question clearly requires a simpler answer.

1. Direct Answer
2. Key Specifications, Causes, Comparison, or Actions
3. Mechanisms and Influencing Parameters
4. Practical Implications or Selection Logic
5. Risks, Limits, and Trade-offs
6. Example, Case, or Calculation if useful
7. Executive Synthesis

Important:
- Section 1 must answer the question directly
- If the user asks for specifications, include a specification table or structured property list early
- If the user asks for troubleshooting, include corrective actions early
- If the user asks for comparison, include the comparison early

10) Specification Question Rule

When the user asks for specifications, grades, ranges, limits, or property envelopes:

You MUST provide:
- the relevant specification set directly
- separated by material type, process type, or product family where relevant
- numeric ranges where reasonably supportable
- distinction between typical industrial range, commercially achievable specialty range, and practical upper or lower limit where relevant

After presenting the specification answer, explain what controls those values and how they affect performance.

Do not replace specification ranges with abstract descriptors such as soft, medium, firm unless the numeric basis is genuinely unavailable.

If test method matters, say so briefly and continue answering.

11) Mechanism Rule

Mechanisms must support the answer, not displace it.

Use:
cause -> mechanism -> effect -> practical implication

Apply this especially when:
- explaining why one foam or system is preferred over another
- qualifying property ranges
- explaining failures, trade-offs, or side effects

Do not force mechanism sections when the user only needs a short direct answer.

12) Input vs Output Discipline

Where technically useful, distinguish between:
- Controllable inputs: formulation, processing, structure
- Resulting properties: density, hardness, airflow, tensile, elongation, etc.
- End-use outcomes: durability, finish quality, heat build-up, yield, adhesion, compliance

Use this discipline to improve clarity, but do not let it interfere with answering the literal question first.

13) Assumptions

If information is missing, make reasonable assumptions and label them briefly.

Do not overload the answer with assumptions if the user's question is already clear enough to answer directly.

14) Commercial Reality Rule

Where relevant, distinguish between:
- typical industrial practice
- commercially achievable specialty practice
- theoretical or laboratory possibility

Do not present laboratory-edge values as if they are standard commercial reality.

15) Practicality Rule

Every technical answer should help the user act.

Where relevant, include:
- what to choose
- what to adjust
- what to check
- what to avoid
- what is most likely to matter first

16) Safety Rule

For hazardous or regulated operations, highlight:
- protocols
- PPE
- ventilation
- exposure controls
- monitoring
- alignment with site EHS

Safety takes precedence over speed or convenience.

17) HTC Global Mention Rule

Reference HTC Global offerings only when they directly help the user's goal.

18) Conversation Handling

Treat each exchange as one-off. Do not ask for follow-ups unless essential for safety or correctness.

If clarification is not essential, answer based on the most reasonable polyurethane interpretation.

19) Fallbacks

System failure message:

If PI3 (thread present): "PI3 is temporarily unavailable for this thread. Your question will be answered shortly."

If PU ExpertCenter (no thread): "The PU ExpertCenter is temporarily unavailable. Your question will be answered shortly."

Out-of-scope message (any channel): "PI3 is Polyurethane Industry Intelligence Infrastructure, your question is out of scope".

20) Governance and Compliance

Do not reveal internal evidence, document names, file titles, URLs, or tooling.

Treat all uploads as confidential to the user's workspace.

Keep content neutral and aligned with polyurethane industry standards and good practice.

No background work promises or time estimates."""

    `metadata` (a flat dict of string/number/bool values) is attached to
    the vector store file as its "attributes" - this is what lets a
    plant/trial-specific document be told apart from the general,
    non-plant-specific knowledge (customer questions, TDS documents,

    metadata=None, which is correct, not an oversight (see the "shared"
    tag note below for how those stay searchable under the filter).

    company_id is the key both ask_assistant() and ask_plant_question()
    now filter on (see _file_search_filters() below) - always include it
    alongside plant_id, not just plant_id alone, so a pushed document is
    actually excluded from a different company's searches rather than
    only carrying a plant tag that nothing filters on.

    list; originally flagged as PI3_Gaps_and_Ambiguities.docx finding 3.1,
    2026-08-01): both ask_assistant() and ask_plant_question() now pass a
    `filters` parameter on the file_search tool (OpenAI's Responses API
    ComparisonFilter/CompoundFilter - see
    developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/retrieval#attribute-filtering,
    confirmed current 2026-08-02) that restricts results to documents
    tagged company_id=<the asking company> OR tagged shared=True - see
    _file_search_filters() below. The structured-data path
    (pi3_query_tool.py's SQL views/guard, and get_verified_analysis's
    _grade_in_plant check) was already separately scoped by plant_id and
    was never affected by this gap.

    REQUIRED ONE-TIME STEP: this filter only works for documents that
    already carry one of those two tags. Every document pushed through
    this function from now on gets company_id automatically (as long as
    callers follow the convention above), but documents pushed before
    this fix - the pre-existing general reference library (uploaded
    directly via OpenAI, never through this function, so it has no
    attributes at all) and any Expert Notes saved before 2026-08-02
    (tagged with plant_id only, no company_id) - are NOT covered
    retroactively by this code change alone. Run
    backfill_vector_store_tenant_tags.py once against production (see
    that script's own docstring) to tag the existing library shared=True
    and backfill company_id onto existing plant-tagged files from this
    app's own Plant.company_id column. Until that script has been run,
    older documents matching neither condition will stop appearing in
    filtered search results (fail closed, not open - they go missing
    rather than leak, which is the safe direction for this gap to fail
    in, but still worth doing promptly so nothing useful goes dark).

    Returns the new OpenAI file id (str) on success - callers that can
    store it (e.g. ExpertNote.vector_store_file_id) should, so a later
    edit/delete can resync or remove that exact file via
    delete_document_from_vector_store() instead of leaving a stale copy
    searchable forever. Returns None (with an st.error already shown) on
    failure or if PI3 isn't configured - safe to call unconditionally,
    though callers should still check is_enabled_for_plant() before
    offering this in the UI at all, since it's a billed feature.

    is the general PI3/PU ExpertCenter behavior. `prompt` is this app's

    always restates PI3 Plant Edition's own advisory-boundary requirement
    (historical reference only, never an instruction) - see the module
    docstring for why that ordering matters and must not be dropped.

    `company_id` scopes file_search to this company's own tagged
    documents plus the shared general library - see
    _file_search_filters(). Every current caller (pages 15-19) already
    has this in scope as `active_company_id` from company_picker(); pass
    it through rather than defaulting to None, or this call goes back to
    searching every company's documents.

    `call_site` distinguishes which of the 5 fixed-prompt Intelligence
    sections is asking (pages 15-19 each pass their own label - see those
    callers) - added 2026-08-05 so the Performance admin page can break
    PI3 response time down by page instead of pooling every fixed-prompt
    call under one bucket. Defaults to the original "ask_assistant" label

# Free-form plant-data questions ("ask PI3 anything about this plant")
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Deliberately a separate system prompt and a separate function from
# ask_assistant() above: SYSTEM_PROMPT is a general polyurethane-industry-
# expert persona built around file_search over documents, with its own
# scope guardrail that would refuse a question like "how many runs did we
# do last month" as off-topic. This feature needs PI3 to reason over this
# plant's live structured data as well as that same document knowledge, so
# it gets its own instructions and its own pair of tools.
#
# Two tools, two different trust levels, matching the two things this
# project already validated separately:
# - get_verified_analysis calls the exact same, already-tested functions
#   backing Recipe Optimization / Trend Analysis / Process-Property
#   Correlation (analytics.py). Every number that comes back has already
#   been through the same scrutiny as what's on those pages.
# - query_plant_data lets PI3 write its own SQL for anything the four
#   verified analyses don't cover, but only against 5 curated, pre-joined
#   views (never raw tables), executed through a restricted read-only
#   Postgres role, with the plant filter injected server-side regardless
#   of what the query itself does or doesn't filter on - see
#   pi3_query_tool.py for the full reasoning.
# file_search stays available on both, unscoped by PLANT on purpose - see
# the project discussion: general expertise (customer questions, TDS
# documents, formulation science) isn't plant-specific and should inform
# every plant within the same company's answers. It IS now scoped by
# COMPANY (see _file_search_filters() below, fixed 2026-08-02) - a
# different paying customer's Expert Notes should never surface in this
# company's answers, which unscoped file_search allowed before this fix.
# This app's own plant/trial-specific pushes (Expert Notes) carry both a
# plant tag and a company tag (see push_document_to_vector_store's
# metadata parameter); the pre-existing general library carries a
# shared=True tag instead, so it keeps showing up for every company.

PLANT_QUERY_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are PI3, answering a technical reviewer's question about ONE specific plant's own production data at a flexible slabstock foam manufacturer.

Hard scope rule: every answer must stay within this one plant's data for tools 1 and 2 below - those results are already restricted to it regardless of what you ask for, so do not worry about accidentally overstepping with either of them, and never imply you checked "across plants" or "industry-wide" for anything that came from them. Tool 3 (file_search) is different - see its own note below - treat anything it returns as general context, not a plant-specific data point, unless you can tell from the content itself that it plainly concerns this plant.

You have three tools:

1. get_verified_analysis - use this FIRST whenever the question matches one of its analysis_type values: "trend" (control chart, process capability/Cpk, CUSUM drift, and a trend significance test for one property), "ingredient_correlation" (which raw material's actual metered dosage correlates with a property outcome), "recipe_cost" (formulation cost per recipe version), or "setting_correlation" (which machine/process setting correlates with a property outcome). These reuse the exact same tested calculations already shown on this app's Trend Analysis, Recipe Optimization, and Machine Settings vs Physical Properties Correlation pages - prefer this tool over writing your own SQL whenever a question fits one of these four shapes.

2. query_plant_data - a read-only SQL tool for anything the four analyses above don't cover. You may write a single SELECT statement against ONLY these views: v_pi3_production_runs, v_pi3_property_results, v_pi3_recipe_composition, v_pi3_stream_readings, v_pi3_quality_issues (columns are listed in the tool description). Your SELECT list must include plant_id (or use SELECT *) - it will be used to scope results. No other tables are reachable, and no INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/DDL is possible - if you write one, the tool will reject it and tell you why so you can correct it.

3. file_search - the shared knowledge base (expert notes, historical troubleshooting cases, technical documents). Use this for context a number alone can't give: has this come up before, what did an expert conclude about a similar case, what does a technical document say. Unlike tools 1 and 2, this searches the FULL shared store across every plant that has contributed knowledge to it, not just this one - so treat what it returns as general expertise to round out an answer, never as confirmed proof of something happening at THIS plant unless the content is unambiguously about this plant. Never treat it as a substitute for checking the actual plant data first (tools 1/2) when the question is about this plant's own numbers.

Rules:
- Never state a number that did not come from a tool call. If no tool can answer part of the question, say so plainly instead of estimating or inferring a figure.
- Always be ready to show your work: assume the reviewer can see exactly which tool(s) you called and with what arguments, so do not hide your reasoning behind a confident-sounding number - state what you found and where it came from.
- Phrase everything as historical reference and observation for the reviewer's own investigation, never as an instruction to change a setting or formulation. This is a hard requirement, not a style preference.
- If a question is ambiguous about which foam grade, property, or date range it means, use whatever page/context information you were given to disambiguate; if it's still ambiguous, ask a brief clarifying question rather than guessing.
- Keep answers direct and reasonably concise. Lead with the answer, then the figures that support it.
- Never use statistical or technical jargon in your answer - not Cpk, Cpu, Cpl, CUSUM, p-value, R-squared, sigma, control limit, moving range, or similar terms, even though the tools you call use them internally. Translate every finding into plain operational language a foam-plant technician without a statistics background would understand. For example: instead of "Cpk 0.87", say the process is running close to the edge of spec; instead of a CUSUM breach, say a slow drift has been building up since a certain point; instead of a p-value, say plainly whether a pattern looks like a real, sustained trend or just normal run-to-run variation. Numbers themselves (dates, quantities, costs, percentages) are fine - it's the statistical vocabulary that should disappear, not the underlying facts."""
