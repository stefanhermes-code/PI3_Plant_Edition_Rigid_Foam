"""
PI3 Plant Edition
Multi-tenant, database-backed login.

Users live in the `users` table (see db.py), not in st.secrets - this is
what makes real customer accounts possible: hashed passwords, a per-account
validity window (valid_from/valid_until), and company/role scoping. A
"company" is the tenant boundary (see db.py Company); a user's role can be
one of the built-in role templates shared by every company (see the
Default User Roles page) or a custom role a company's own admin defines
on the User Roles page. "Company Admin" is the structurally required
template every regular company is seeded with - see access_control.
STRUCTURALLY_REQUIRED_ROLE_NAMES - so its own admin pages always stay
reachable; renamed 2026-08-05 from "Platform Admin" (itself renamed
2026-08-04 from the old literal "admin"), since that name misled
customers into thinking their own admin had cross-company platform-owner
power - it never did (see require_platform_owner() below for what
actually does). HTC's own company keeps a role literally named "Platform
Admin" instead, on purpose - both names satisfy the exact same
require_role() checks (see pages 24/25), so HTC's own admin is never
worse off than a customer's, just labeled to match reality: HTC is the
platform owner, every other company is a company.

Legacy fallback: if the `users` table has zero rows at all (a deployment
that hasn't been through the new User Accounts admin page yet), login
falls back to the old st.secrets [users.<name>] blocks so an existing
deployment isn't locked out mid-migration. The moment at least one real DB
user exists, secrets.toml-based login is ignored entirely - there is no
way to have both active at once, to avoid two disagreeing sources of truth
for who's allowed in.

Roles: full access ("Company Admin", or "Platform Admin" for HTC's own
company) down to read-only ("Read Only"), plus whatever else a company or
the platform owner has added as a template on the Default User Roles
page - not a fixed 3-tier list. "Company Admin"/"Platform Admin" gets
full access within its own company, including managing that company's
users/custom roles; only the platform owner (HTC) can manage Companies
or Subscription Types, regardless of any company's own admin role name -
that's gated by Company.is_platform_owner, not by role (see
require_platform_owner()).

is_super_admin (User.is_super_admin): an unconditional bypass of every
RolePagePermission check, independent of role name or is_platform_owner -
see db.py's User docstring for why this exists separately from
is_platform_owner. Only ever set on a platform-owner-company user (the
User Accounts page only offers the toggle in that context).

Expected st.secrets structure for the legacy fallback only (see
.streamlit/secrets.toml.example):

[users.jane]
password = "changeme"
display_name = "Jane Doe"
role = "Company Admin"
