"""Industrial Intelligence: Root-Cause Assistant

Given a quality observation, surfaces what was different about that run
compared to the most recent prior run of the same foam grade - recipe
version, machine, or Finalized-phase process settings - as a starting
point for the reviewer's own investigation. Historical comparison for
technical review (see the advisory boundary at the bottom of this page).

            "reviewer to investigate and confirm themselves.\n\n"

            "reviewed by a formulation expert and found too quick to rank causes without "
            "enough evidence - follow these rules to avoid repeating that):\n"
            "1. State any percentage change to at least two decimal places, exactly as given "
            "below - never round '-3.47%' down to '-3%'.\n"
            "2. Before proposing any ranking, first ask what is actually known about the "
            "failure itself: did it collapse while still rising, settle immediately at peak "
            "rise, or shrink later during cooling? Was it localized or across the whole bun? "
            "What did the cell structure look like (coarse, ruptured, tight, normal)? If this "
            "app's data does not capture that, say so explicitly and list it as the first, "
            "still-open investigation item - do not silently assume a failure mode.\n"
            "3. Do not call any subset of hypotheses 'leading' or imply a priority ordering "
            "unless you can point to a specific piece of evidence in the comparison or the "
            "knowledge base that favors one hypothesis over another. If no such evidence "
            "exists, present hypotheses as an unranked candidate set and say the ranking "
            "requires more evidence (morphology, timing, actual-vs-setpoint deliveries).\n"
            "4. Give equal analytical weight to overall stoichiometry/index and mixing "
            "factors (water dosage, isocyanate/TDI delivery and index, component "
            "temperatures, mixing energy or pressure, polyol-blend homogeneity) alongside "
            "additive-level factors (silicone, catalysts). The fact that air injection is "
            "the only recorded numeric difference does not mean other factors are less "
            "likely - it only means this app didn't capture a difference in them for this "
            "comparison. Do not let one recorded change anchor the whole explanation.\n"
            "5. When discussing amine catalysts, do not say 'excessive amine' as a blanket "
            "statement. Amine catalysts vary - some are blow-selective, some gel-selective, "
            "some balanced. Frame this hypothesis as 'excessive effective blow catalysis "
            "relative to gel development', and note it could come from over-delivery of a "
            "blow-selective amine, under-delivery/deactivation of tin, excess water, a low "
            "index, temperature-driven acceleration, or a wrong catalyst grade/concentration.\n"
            "6. Keep 'reduced/wrong silicone performance' (wrong grade, degraded, incompatible, "
            "under- or over-dosed, poor blending) analytically separate from 'foreign-material "
            "contamination' (mold-release agent, external oil/grease, defoamer, cleaning "
            "residue, water). Do not describe silicone itself as a contaminant - it is a "
            "deliberate formulation component. Note that too much silicone/stabilization can "
            "also cause tight cells and shrinkage, not just too little causing collapse.\n"
            "7. Comment on whether the comparison run is actually a sound baseline (same "
            "formulation, comparable density, similar raw-material lots, comparable "
            "temperatures, same equipment configuration, no intervening maintenance) - if "

            "directly known (the recorded change) versus what is inferred, and avoid "
