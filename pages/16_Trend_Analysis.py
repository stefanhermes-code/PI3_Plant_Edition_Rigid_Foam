"""Industrial Intelligence: Trend Analysis

A plot of actual-vs-target over time can't, by itself, tell a reviewer
whether a wobble is real or just noise, or when a real shift actually
started - that is what statistical process control (SPC) exists for. This
page runs the standard SPC toolkit for one property tracked over
production runs: an individuals control chart with real control limits and
the classic Western Electric/Nelson run rules (catches sudden shifts),
process capability (Cpk) against the property's own tolerance band
(catches "in control but too close to spec"), a CUSUM chart (catches slow
sustained drift a control chart is bad at catching early - pump wear,
catalyst degradation, an off-spec raw material lot), and a formal trend
test (replaces an eyeballed first-half-vs-second-half average with an
actual significance test). All four are deterministic - see analytics.py.
PI3 is used only downstream of these numbers, to help interpret a real
flag against recipe changes, machine changes, and quality issue history -
never to guess whether a trend exists in the first place.
