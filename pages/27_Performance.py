"""Screen 27: Performance

Added 2026-08-02 after a reported "app feels slow in general", expanded
2026-08-05 (v2.0 performance audit) to cover three separate things that
were previously invisible, each measured only as real usage happens - none
of these run on a fixed schedule:

1. Page load time (PageLoadLog) - the FULL page-script execution time,
   logged once per Streamlit rerun of ANY page (a fresh navigation and
   every widget-triggered rerun on that same page - see app.py's single
   st.navigation() pg.run() call, timed centrally there so no individual
   page file needed to be touched). This is the direct answer to the
   original complaint ("a simple screen-build takes 15-20 seconds").
2. PI3 call time (PI3InteractionLog.response_time_ms) - already captured
   for every PI3 call since the Gate 6 audit-logging batch (items 49-51),
   just not surfaced anywhere until now. Broken down by call_site - the 5
   fixed-prompt Intelligence-page sections each pass their own label (see
   ai_assistant.ask_assistant()'s call_site parameter) plus the free-form
   "Ask PI3" box.
3. Shared data-loading function time (PerformanceLog) - the original
   metric this page shipped with: analytics.py's three functions
   (run_settings_dataframe, property_results_dataframe,
   actual_usage_dataframe), each logging one row only on a cache MISS (a
   cache HIT never re-executes the function body, so it never reaches the
   logging call either - see analytics._log_performance). The most
   granular/technical of the three, kept last.

Each section below guards its own "no data yet" case independently rather
than the whole page stopping if just one of the three tables is empty -
PageLoadLog in particular will already have plenty of rows from ordinary
navigation long before anyone has triggered a PerformanceLog cache miss.

Platform-owner-only (see auth.require_platform_owner): this is an
operational/engineering view of the deployment itself, not something a
customer company's own admin needs or should see - same reasoning as
PI3 Connectivity and the other Application Admin pages. See
access_control.py's PLATFORM_ONLY_KEYS.
