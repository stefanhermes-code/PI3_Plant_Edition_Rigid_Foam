"""Industrial Intelligence: Recipe Optimization

Recipe optimization means answering questions a raw ingredient list and a
results table can't answer by themselves: what does the current formulation
actually cost, and which ingredient's dosage is actually associated with
the property outcome - ranked and quantified, not eyeballed. PI3's
recommendation is grounded in those answers rather than a plain text dump
of ingredients and averages (see the advisory boundary at the bottom of
this page).

A recipe version replaces the previous one in production rather than
coexisting with it, so the page leads with the CURRENT version only.
Cost-by-version comparison, the version-diff tool, and older versions'
ingredient lists are all still available, just moved into "Version
history" at the bottom, since that's occasional-audit territory, not
day-to-day use.
