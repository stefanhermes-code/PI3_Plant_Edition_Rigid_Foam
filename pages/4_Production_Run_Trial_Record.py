"""Screen 5: Production Run

The primary, self-sufficient record of a batch: recipe used, machine
parameters, and (elsewhere) the quality results it produced. This is
routine, everyday data entry - it does NOT require framing a run as an
experiment. A deliberate trial/change investigation is captured as its own
independent Customer Trial or Optimization Trial record instead (see
pages/11_Customer_Trials.py / pages/12_Optimization_Trials.py) - the old
"Trial / Experiment" flag on a production run itself, and the standalone
Trial / Experiment page, were removed along with TrialRecord/
AdjustmentConclusion/ApprovalRecord (see cascades.py/db.py history).

Includes the Mandatory-tier process-data capture recommended in "Expanding
PI3 Plant Edition Production-Trial Data Capture for Polyurethane Foaming
Lines", adapted to what's actually capturable without a live PLC/OPC UA/MQTT
link or a machine data export/import: each run gets exactly two phase
snapshots, Setup (planned/configured before the run) and Finalized (what
actually happened, entered at shutdown).

Laid out as one tab per function: Production Runs (overview/edit/delete +
create), Setup, Runtime Data, Component Stream Readings, and Production
Events. Every function tab (other than Production Runs) opens with a
production-run selector shared with the other tabs, shows that run's related
record(s) with edit + delete, and keeps CSV/Excel bulk import as its own
sub-tab. Raw material lot tracking has been removed from this page (not
workable — batches get mixed in tanks); the underlying table is left
untouched in the schema.

Setup and Runtime Data used to be a single generic "Process Phases" tab (a
phase_name dropdown picking which of the two ProductionPhase snapshots you
were editing) plus a separate standalone "Runtime Data" tab backed by its
own RuntimeDataRecord table — the two were doing overlapping work (e.g.
RuntimeDataRecord.line_speed duplicating ProductionPhase.conveyor_speed).
Restructured 2026-08-02 into two dedicated tabs instead: Setup (hardcoded to
the "Setup" ProductionPhase row) and Runtime Data (hardcoded to the
"Finalized" ProductionPhase row, now also carrying rise_time — one of the
two fields RuntimeDataRecord had that nothing else captured (the other,
curing_notes, was removed from the app entirely on 2026-08-03 - not a real,
reliably-captured field in practice). See RuntimeDataRecord in db.py for
why that table is still there but retired.

Setup's field set was narrowed again on 2026-08-03, after feedback that
several fields shown there weren't actually Setup-appropriate: foam_height_mm
(a measured outcome of the foaming process, not something planned) and the
ambient temperature/humidity readings (observed conditions, not configured)
moved to Runtime Data only; ratio_index moved off ProductionPhase entirely
onto RecipeVersion (it's a formulation constant, not a per-run setting - see
db.py); the free-text "laydown_mode" field was renamed "Foaming mode" and
converted to a controlled dropdown (FOAMING_MODES: LLD/Trough/Traverse); the
free-text "Other geometry notes" field was dropped now that fall-plate
section positions are captured in structured form below it; and a new
top_flat_system_used yes/no field was added. Both Setup and Runtime Data
still carry the shared machine settings (mixer/conveyor/air/sidewall/foaming
mode/top-flat), so the plan-vs-actual comparison still works for those.
