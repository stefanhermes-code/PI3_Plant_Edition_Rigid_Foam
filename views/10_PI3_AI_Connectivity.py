"""Screen 11: PI3 Connectivity

Standard version (always included): Search, Compare, Retrieve, Structure,
Report, Review and Approval.

Optional PI3 connectivity (this screen): Assisted interpretation,
question answering, advisory comparison, company-specific knowledge
interface. Separate annual fee. Disabled unless explicitly enabled in
admin settings. Even when enabled, final decisions require human review
and approval — no autonomous formulation commands, ever.

This screen owns the per-plant enable/disable toggle and commercial fee.
The actual PI3 reasoning layer (OpenAI's Responses API, with file_search
over a vector store of historical trial narratives and expert notes)
lives in ai_assistant.py.

The whole page is platform-owner-only (see auth.require_platform_owner):
this is HTC's own commercial add-on switch, not something a company's own
admin self-serves, even at a company whose subscription includes PI3/AI.
It used to be visible (read-only) to any company admin, with just the
toggle itself gated - moved to platform-owner-only entirely once it became
clear that left non-owner admins looking at a page with nothing they could
actually do. See access_control.py's PLATFORM_ONLY_KEYS.
