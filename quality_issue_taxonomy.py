"""Controlled vocabulary for the Quality Issue page's "Issue type" field.

Added 2026-08-01, replacing a bare free-text field (previously any string
was accepted, e.g. "hardness drift", "shrinkage", "collapse", "splitting" -
whatever the person typing happened to call it that day, with no way to
later group/count/trend issues reliably since two people describing the
same fault would use different words).

QUALITY_ISSUE_TAXONOMY below is sourced from Laader Berg's "Troubleshooting
Guide For Slabstock Foaming" (Revision 2010, Release 2014-01-01) - the
FAULT column of that guide's fault/recommendation tables becomes the
`name` here, and the RECOMMENDATION column (condensed to plain language)
becomes `typical_causes`, shown to the person logging the issue as
reference/guidance once they pick a type, not as instructions to follow
blindly - it's the same "reference for human judgement, not a directive"
posture the rest of this app uses for PI3 output.

Consolidation note: the source guide lists several splits/cracks faults
that differ mainly by WHERE on the block they appear (bottom corner,
shoulder, centre, small side, inclined, chimney over the trough inlets,
...) rather than by distinct underlying mechanism. Encoding each of those
as its own taxonomy entry would just duplicate the "Location in block"
field this page already has. Split-type entries below are consolidated by
mechanism/appearance instead; the reviewer captures the specific position
in "Location in block" and "Notes" as before.

Structure: an ordered dict of category -> list of issue-type dicts, each
with `name` (the controlled value actually stored in
QualityObservation.observation_type - unchanged column, still a plain
string, just no longer free-typed) and `typical_causes` (guidance text).
The last category, "Routine / No Issue", also carries the escape hatch
for a genuine one-off that doesn't match anything here yet ("Other").

No schema/migration needed: QualityObservation.observation_type stays a
String(200) column exactly as before - this module only changes what the
UI lets a person choose to put into it. Historical rows already in the
database (demo data, UAT data, or anything imported before this taxonomy
existed) that don't match any `name` below still display and edit fine -
see pages/6_Quality_Observation.py's handling of a legacy/unmatched value.
