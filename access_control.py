"""Shared page-visibility rules for the multi-tenant admin layer.

Three independent things can hide a page from the current user, checked in
this order by `page_visible()`:

1. Platform-only pages (Companies, Subscription Types, PI3 Connectivity) -
   only ever visible to a user whose company is the platform owner (HTC
   itself), regardless of role. Not configurable per role; this is a hard
   gate. PI3 Connectivity joined this group after starting out merely
   subscription-gated (see point 2's history) - its edit form was already
   platform-owner-only (this is HTC's own commercial add-on switch, not
   something a company's own admin self-serves), so a company admin who
   could still open the page only ever saw a read-only status view with no
   action available. Not worth a page of its own for that - moved in with
   Companies/Subscription Types instead.
2. Subscription feature flags - REPORT_KEYS (reports_enabled) is the one
   remaining subscription-tier feature switch. PI3/AI used to work the
   same way (pi3_ai_enabled hiding the PI3 Connectivity page for anyone
   whose company lacked it), but since that page is now platform-only
   regardless of tier (point 1), pi3_ai_enabled no longer has any runtime
   enforcement effect, and as of 2026-08-01 it no longer even triggers a
   warning anywhere in the UI - it's tracked on SubscriptionType purely as
   an internal commercial record of which tier a company is sold on. The
   platform owner (HTC) has the unilateral right to enable PI3 connectivity
   for any plant regardless of what this flag says, with no confirmation
   step in the way; a customer is never shown that this flag exists or
   that a higher tier would unlock anything, since customers don't
   self-serve this switch in the first place (see PI3 Connectivity page,
   platform-owner-only). Every operational page - including Recipe
   Optimization, Trend Analysis, Machine Settings Correlation, Root-Cause
   Assistant, and Machine Settings Optimization - stays visible on every
   tier, because each already has its own deterministic core that works
   with zero PI3 involvement (cost/diff calculations, correlation ranking,
   control charts/Cpk/CUSUM, the run-vs-prior-run diff, ...) and
   independently checks per-plant PI3 enablement
   (ai_assistant.is_enabled_for_plant / any_plant_enabled) before rendering
   its own "Ask PI3" section. An earlier version of this file bundled
   those pages behind their own feature flags
   (industrial_intelligence_enabled / case_review_enabled) - that was
   wrong: it hid real, PI3-independent value from Basic customers instead
   of letting each page's own PI3 check do its job. Similar Case Retrieval
   used to be part of this group too, but the whole page was dropped on
   2026-08-01 (see below) - it never demonstrated real added value beyond
   what Expert Notes and the search-first workflow already cover, and its
   "Also use PI3" toggle could search across every company's data, a
   cross-tenant leak the other PI3-touching pages don't have.
3. Role page permissions - a DENY list, not an allow list (see db.py's
   RolePagePermission docstring): a role with no rows sees everything, in
   full; an explicit row can hide a page entirely (can_view=False) or make
   it view-only (can_view=True, can_use=False - the page renders and its
   data can be read, but its own Add/Edit/Delete forms and action buttons
   should be hidden). The three-state picker (Hidden / View only / Full
   access) is built and edited on the Default User Roles page (platform
   owner - sets what new companies start with) and the User Roles page
   (per company) via current_access_states()/save_access_states() below.

   Enforcing view-only INSIDE a page (hiding/disabling its own write
   controls) is a page-by-page opt-in, not automatic just because the row
   exists - a page checks its own usability with can_use_page() (or the
   set-based usable_page_keys_denied() for pages with several independent
   write actions to gate) and conditionally disables/skips rendering its
   forms and action buttons. As of 2026-08-01 this is rolled out on every
   operational page with a write action: Plant & Foam Equipment Overview,
   Product Family & Foam Grade, Recipes, Production Run, Quality Test
   Result, Quality Issue, Production Samples, Customer Trials & Samples,
   Optimization Trials & Samples, Raw Materials, Expert
   Notes, Recipe Optimization, Trend Analysis, Machine Settings
   Correlation, and Root-Cause Assistant (their "Ask PI3"/"Save to Expert
   Notes" actions), and Machine Settings Optimization (its single, fixed-
   prompt "Get PI3 interpretation" button - unlike the other four PI3-
   enabled pages, this one has no free-form "Ask PI3" box or "Save to
   Expert Notes" action of its own; corrected 2026-08-01, see
   PI3_Gaps_and_Ambiguities.docx finding 2.1, which caught this docstring
   overstating what the page actually offers). The Report page is
   deliberately NOT gated - every control on it is a preview or a
   PDF/Excel download, nothing writes to the database, so there is
   nothing for view-only to restrict. The 4 platform-only pages
   (Companies, Subscription Types, PI3 Connectivity, plus the two
   role-name-gated admin pages User Roles/User Accounts) are also
   unaffected - those are gated by page_visible()'s platform-only rule or
   a literal admin role-name check, not by can_use.

PAGE_CATALOG is the single source of truth for page_key -> display title,
used both to build app.py's nav and to render the permission grid on the
User Roles / Default User Roles admin pages.
