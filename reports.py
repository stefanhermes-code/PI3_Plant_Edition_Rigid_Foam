"""Report generation: data assembly + Word (.docx) rendering.

"Report" is one of PI3 Plant Edition's own standard, always-included
capabilities (see pages/10_PI3_AI_Connectivity.py's docstring: "Standard
version (always included): Search, Compare, Retrieve, Structure, Report,
Review and Approval.") - this module is what had been missing. It is not
gated behind PI3 connectivity; every logged-in user can generate reports.

Two report types that predate the 2026-08-04 Reports redesign, each with a
data-assembly function (plain dict, no Streamlit import, easy to unit
test) and a Word (.docx) renderer (PDF/Excel renderers were removed
2026-08-04; every report now exports to Word only):

- build_period_summary_data() / render_period_summary_docx()
  One plant/product family/date range: KPIs, pass rate, recurring issues,
  the run list, and a breakdown by foam grade.
- build_trial_report_data() / render_trial_report_docx()
  One closed Customer Trial or Optimization Trial (see db.CustomerTrial /
  db.OptimizationTrial - the two independent lab-trial flows, added
  2026-08-03): objective/hypothesis, what changed, outcome/conclusion,
  reviewer sign-off - a formal closeout writeup. Rebuilt 2026-08-04 to
  cover these two (the trials people actually use) after the old
  TrialRecord concept (a formal-experiment flag on a production run) was
  removed - zero real rows across 244 production runs, fully superseded
  by these two independent, self-contained closeout flows.

pages/21_Report.py wires these to selectors, an in-app preview, and
st.download_button for both file formats.

Two purpose-built reports for the Recipes page (pages/3_Recipe_Version_
Record.py), added 2026-08-04 as the first output of the app-wide Reports
redesign (see PI3_Gaps note: reports must be aggregated/purpose-built
answers to a specific question, never a raw-data dump or a PI3-narrative
document - the CSV export on every table already covers raw-data needs,
and PI3's own Word download on relevant pages already covers narrative):

- build_recipe_formulation_record_data() / render_recipe_formulation_record_pdf()
  / render_recipe_formulation_record_excel()
  One recipe version: the formulation itself (materials/php/supplier/
  role), its quality specs vs. actual results aggregated over a chosen
  date range (across every production run/customer trial/optimization
  trial built on this recipe version), and cost per kg - "is this
  formulation meeting spec, and what does it cost" in one document for
  internal use/approval (not customer-facing - a customer-facing version
  would need to omit the formulation itself).
- build_where_used_report_data() / render_where_used_report_pdf()
  / render_where_used_report_excel()
  One raw material: every recipe version (active and retired) that uses
  it with its php/role, the target properties of every foam grade
  affected, and any Customer/Optimization Trial precedent tied to a
  recipe version containing it - "if I replace this material, what's
  affected and what trials already exist to lean on."

A third purpose-built report, added 2026-08-04 for one production run -
REPLACING the earlier build_run_report_data() / render_run_report_pdf() /
render_run_report_excel() (removed the same day: a flat header plus four
raw tables - recipe components, process settings, quality results,
quality issues - with no synthesis, exactly the "factual but not adding
value" pattern the whole Reports redesign exists to fix). Lives on the
Report page (pages/21_Report.py), not the Production Run page itself: per
user direction, a report whose subject is a single simple choice (pick
one run from a dropdown) belongs on the Report page alongside the other
selector-driven reports; a report whose subject needs a comprehensive
multi-field selection first (date range, foam grade, etc. - see the
Quality Test Result report below) belongs on its own page instead, next
to where that selection naturally happens.

- build_batch_release_record_data() / render_batch_release_record_pdf()
  / render_batch_release_record_excel()
  One production run: the recipe used (in full - not just a reference),
  and a rolled-up quality conformance verdict (Pass/Fail per tested
  property plus one overall Conforming/Non-conforming/Incomplete verdict)
  and any quality issues recorded. If - and only if - a flag is raised
  (a failed result or a recorded quality issue), the report widens to
  pull supporting context from every other tab on the Production Run
  page: Setup-vs-Finalized process-setting deviations (including
  fall-plate position changes), the Finalized phase's actual component
  stream readings (with any non-"Valid" calibration status called out),
  and any Production Events logged during the run - "does this batch
  look wrong, and if so what else was going on at the time" in one
  document, not five separate tab exports. A clean run stays a short
  document; a flagged one pulls in exactly what's relevant, not
  everything that exists.

A fifth report, added 2026-08-04, lives on its own page rather than the
Report page - per the same placement principle stated above, this report's
subject is a comprehensive multi-field selection (Pass/Fail, Property, and
Foam scope), not a single dropdown choice, so it lives on
pages/5_Physical_Property_Result.py, right below the filter controls and
the existing on-page Pareto chart it shares its scope with:

- build_quality_test_report_data() / render_quality_test_report_pdf()
  / render_quality_test_report_excel()
  Takes the exact set of PhysicalPropertyResult rows the page has already
  scoped (tenant) and filtered (Pass/Fail, Property, Foam scope) - the
  report never re-derives its own selection, so it always matches what's
  on screen. Aggregates that set into a pass-rate summary, a failures-by-
  property breakdown (bar chart), a pass/fail-by-foam-grade breakdown
  (bar chart, only shown when the selection spans more than one grade),
  and a curated table of just the failing results (target/actual/
  deviation) - not the full underlying row set, which the page's own CSV
  export already covers.

A sixth report, added 2026-08-04, follows the same placement logic as the
Quality Test Result report - its subject is a comprehensive multi-field
selection (Severity, Foam scope, and the breakdown's group-by choice), not
a single dropdown choice, so it lives on pages/6_Quality_Observation.py
itself, right below that page's own filters and breakdown-by-issue chart:

- build_quality_issue_report_data() / render_quality_issue_report_pdf()
  / render_quality_issue_report_excel()
  Takes the exact set of QualityObservation rows the page has already
  scoped and filtered (Severity, Foam scope) - never re-derives its own
  selection. Aggregates that set into a severity/recurring-vs-one-off
  summary, a confidence-level breakdown, an issues-by-type-or-category
  breakdown (bar chart, matching whichever grouping the page's own
  breakdown chart was using), and a curated table of just the priority
  issues (High severity and/or Recurring) - not every row, which the
  page's own CSV export already covers.

An eighth report, added 2026-08-04, follows the same placement logic as
Batch Release Record and Trial Closeout Report - picking one sample is a
single simple choice, so it lives on the Report page rather than pages
9/11/12 (which already have the aggregate, multi-field-selection Sample
Report added the same day):

- build_sample_certificate_data() / render_sample_certificate_pdf()
  / render_sample_certificate_excel()
  One sample, across any of the three sources (Production Run / Customer
  Trial / Optimization Trial): where it came from (header context), the
  sample itself (zone, sampled time, notes), the recipe used in full (not
  customer-facing as-is, same caveat as Recipe Formulation Record and
  Batch Release Record), that sample's own quality test results, and a
  rolled-up Conforming/Non-conforming/Incomplete verdict - a per-sample
  certificate of analysis, distinct from the aggregate Sample Report
  (which covers many samples at once via charts, no per-sample detail).

A ninth, narrower report type lives here too:

- build_pi3_qa_report_data() / render_pi3_qa_report_docx()
  A single "Ask PI3" question-and-answer exchange (see
  helpers.render_ask_pi3_section) - the question, PI3's answer, and an
  appendix of the exact data PI3 checked to produce it (SQL + rows
  returned, or the verified-analysis arguments and result). Like every
  other report in this module, this is Word (.docx) only, and it is always
  built from this same code path, so every export has identical
  formatting regardless of who generates it or what was asked - a
  hand-maintained Word template would drift over time; this can't.

A tenth through fifteenth report, added 2026-08-04 for the Industrial
Intelligence section (per user direction: pages with a PI3 recommendation/
interpretation get a Context/Analysis/Conclusions report ON the page
itself, built from that page's own deterministic analysis - never the PI3
answer, which already has its own separate Word download via
render_pi3_docx_download). Each build_*_report_data() takes the exact
already-computed analysis object(s) the calling page has on screen at that
moment - ranked DataFrame, SPC results, diff list, etc. - and never
re-derives them, so the report always matches what's on screen:

- build_recipe_optimization_report_data() / render_recipe_optimization_report_pdf()
  / render_recipe_optimization_report_excel() (pages/15_Recipe_Optimization.py)
  Current formulation cost, whether the current recipe meets target per
  property, and the top ingredient-dosage correlation for the selected
  property.
- build_trend_analysis_report_data() / render_trend_analysis_report_pdf()
  / render_trend_analysis_report_excel() (pages/16_Trend_Analysis.py)
  Control chart, process capability, CUSUM, and trend-test results, plus
  the machine-change/quality-issue timeline - the full SPC toolkit for one
  property.
- build_correlation_report_data() / render_correlation_report_pdf()
  / render_correlation_report_excel() (pages/17_Process_Property_Correlation.py)
  The ranked machine-setting-vs-property correlation table.
- build_root_cause_report_data() / render_root_cause_report_pdf()
  / render_root_cause_report_excel() (pages/18_Root_Cause_Assistant.py)
  The deterministic run-vs-prior-run diff (recipe/machine/process-setting
  shifts) behind a flagged quality issue.
- build_machine_settings_report_data() / render_machine_settings_report_pdf()
  / render_machine_settings_report_excel() (pages/19_Machine_Settings_Optimization.py)
  The ranked setting-optimization table (which range of each setting
  separates good outcomes from bad).
- build_expert_notes_report_data() / render_expert_notes_report_pdf()
  / render_expert_notes_report_excel() (pages/20_Expert_Notes.py)
  Doesn't fit the pattern above (no PI3 recommendation of its own) - an
  always-visible aggregate breakdown of the notes already shown on the
  page, by confidence level, source (Manual vs. PI3), and linked-entity
  type, distinct from the existing conditional per-note Word re-download
  (kept as-is - see that button's own comment on pages/20_Expert_Notes.py).

#
# Covers the two independent lab-trial flows (see db.CustomerTrial /
# db.OptimizationTrial, added 2026-08-03) - NOT the old TrialRecord concept
# (a formal-experiment flag on a production run), which was removed
# 2026-08-04 after confirming zero real rows across 244 production runs.
# The two models have different closeout fields (a sales-driven Customer
# Trial has customer_name/outcome/customer_feedback; an internally-driven
# Optimization Trial has hypothesis/conclusion/reuse_recommendation), so
# build_trial_report_data() normalizes both into one common "narrative
# fields" list of (label, value) pairs the renderer can walk without
# needing to know which trial type produced them.

# joins on RecipeComponent.raw_material_id, a real FK to one specific
# (already company-scoped) raw_materials row, not a name match, so it
# can't cross into another company's recipes.

# is there anything on record I should know" - not a transcription of
# every stored field on the run. A clean run gets a short document,
# header + recipe + verdict. A FLAGGED run (a failed quality result, or
# any recorded quality issue) widens to pull relevant context from every
# other tab on the Production Run page - Setup-vs-Finalized process
# settings, actual component stream readings, and Production Events -
# because a flag's explanation often isn't on the same tab as the flag
# itself.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Tolerance for treating two ProductionPhase float settings as "the same"
# rather than flagging a deviation - avoids surfacing meaningless float
# noise (25.000001 vs 25.0) as if it were a real setpoint change.

# Placement/mechanism (per user direction 2026-08-04): picking one sample
# is a single simple choice - same as Batch Release Record and Trial
# Closeout Report - so this lives on the Report page (pages/21_Report.py)
# rather than on pages 9/11/12 themselves (which already have the
# aggregate, multi-field-selection Sample Report).
#
# "What is this sample, what recipe made it, what did testing find, and
# did it pass" in one document - works across all three sample sources
# (Production Run / Customer Trial / Optimization Trial - see
# db.SAMPLE_SOURCE_TYPES). Includes the full recipe formulation (materials/
# php/supplier/role), same as Batch Release Record and Recipe Formulation
# Record - per that same precedent, this makes the report NOT customer-
# facing as-is; a customer-facing version would need to omit section C
# (the formulation table).

#
# Placement/mechanism (per user direction 2026-08-04): same pattern as the
# Quality Test Result and Quality Issue reports - a comprehensive,
# multi-field selection built up on the page itself (which run/trial(s),
# which company/plant scope is active), so it lives on each of pages 9/11/
# 12 rather than as a single dropdown choice on the Report page. This
# function is source_type-aware (Production Run / Customer Trial /
# Optimization Trial - see db.SAMPLE_SOURCE_TYPES) but otherwise identical
# across all three pages, so it's one shared function rather than three
# near-duplicates.
#
# This report purely aggregates the exact Sample id set the calling page
# has already scoped (tenant) and filtered - it does not apply any scope
# or filtering of its own. Answers two questions a raw sample list can't:
# how complete is this selection's traceability (coverage - the % of
# samples that actually have a quality test result attached), and what did
# testing find once it happened (pass/fail rate of just the results linked
# to these samples) - both as charts, per the Reports redesign ruling that
# no report in this app dumps a raw row-by-row table.

# is being replaced with a "Download Word" button (the user's original,
# earlier instruction was Word format throughout - PDF was a mistake on
# this app's part). Rather than hand-roll python-docx calls in each of the
# 15 render_*_docx functions below, these helpers mirror the PDF-side
# building blocks (_title_block/_key_value_table/_section/_bar_chart/
# _line_chart) one-for-one, so every render_*_docx function reads almost
# identically to its render_*_pdf twin. Charts reuse the exact same
# reportlab Drawing objects the PDF uses (_build_bar_chart_drawing/
# _build_line_chart_drawing above) rasterized to PNG via renderPM, so the
# chart itself is pixel-identical between the two formats, not a
# separately-drawn approximation.

# 10. Recipe Optimization Report (Context / Analysis / Conclusions)
#
# Added 2026-08-04 as part of the Industrial Intelligence reports batch (per
# user direction: "For most of the pages we have a PI3 Word generator on the
# actual page... These reports should have: A. Context B. Analysis
# C. Conclusions. The PI3 button stays on is only for the PI3 analysis or
# answer of a question."). Deliberately NOT the PI3-generated recommendation
# further up the page (that already has its own Word download via
# render_pi3_docx_download) - this is the page's own deterministic analysis:
# does the current recipe meet target, and where it doesn't, which raw
# material's actual dosage is the strongest lead. Lives on
# pages/15_Recipe_Optimization.py itself (a comprehensive multi-field
# selection - foam grade, include-trials toggle, correlation property - not
# a single dropdown choice), same placement logic as the Quality Test Result
# Report. build_recipe_optimization_report_data() never re-derives the
# page's own selection - it takes the exact grade, current recipe version,
# cost, expectation summary, and correlation ranking the page has already
# computed, so the report always matches what's on screen.

# 15. Expert Notes Report (Context / Analysis / Conclusions)
#
# Added 2026-08-04, closing out the Industrial Intelligence reports batch.
# Expert Notes doesn't fit either bucket the other 5 pages fall into (it
# has no PI3-generated recommendation of its own to report on - the
# existing conditional "Download as Word" button on a PI3-sourced note is
# kept as-is, unchanged, per user direction: "The PI3 button stays on is
# only for the PI3 analysis or answer of a question"). Instead this is a
# standing aggregate over the notes the page is already showing - a
# breakdown by confidence level, source (Manual vs PI3), and linked-entity
# type - always visible, not conditional on selecting one note. Lives on
# pages/20_Expert_Notes.py itself. build_expert_notes_report_data() takes
# the exact `notes` list the page has already scoped (tenant) and is
# already showing in its table - never re-derived.
