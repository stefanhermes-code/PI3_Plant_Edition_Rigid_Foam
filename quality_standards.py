"""Industry accepted tolerances for physical property Pass/Fail.

Added 2026-08-01, replacing a flat +/-10%-of-target band that was applied
uniformly to every property regardless of what it actually measures.
INDUSTRY_TOLERANCES below holds a published/accepted foam-testing tolerance
per property (aligned to ASTM D-3574 test methods) rather than an
assumption.

Each property is tagged with HOW its tolerance number is interpreted,
because that genuinely differs by property rather than being one uniform
rule - conflating the two is exactly what went wrong here across three
rounds of correction on 2026-08-01/02:
- "relative": the number is a PERCENTAGE OF THE TARGET VALUE. Example: Ball
  rebound resilience target 48%, tolerance 5 -> allowed band is target +/-
  (5% of 48) = 48 +/- 2.4, i.e. 45.6-50.4.
- "absolute": the number is a FIXED AMOUNT in the property's own unit,
  independent of the target's magnitude. Example: Density target 25 kg/m3,
  tolerance 2 -> allowed band is 25 +/- 2.0 kg/m3, i.e. 23.0-27.0 (a plant
  doesn't get a wider allowance just because it's targeting a
  higher-density grade). Compression set works the same way even though
  the property itself is measured in %: target 8%, tolerance 1 -> allowed
  band is 8 +/- 1 percentage point, i.e. 7%-9% - NOT 8% of the target
  value (which would be a far tighter +/- 0.08 band). Elongation at break
  and Ball rebound resilience work the same way, confirmed 2026-08-02:
  target 48% ball rebound, tolerance 5 -> allowed band is 48 +/- 5
  percentage points, i.e. 43%-53% - NOT 5% of 48 (the previous, incorrect
  "relative" reading, which gave 45.6-50.4, a much tighter and wrong
  band). The published tolerance numbers themselves (5 and 10) are
  unchanged from before this fix - only the mode moved from "relative" to
  "absolute", exactly as already done for Density and Compression set.

unit_label is retained purely to describe what unit the property's
target/actual values are themselves measured in for display (e.g. in the
Recipe Optimization "meet target" table via tolerance_label()) - for an
"absolute" property it is also the unit the tolerance number itself is
in; for a "relative" property the tolerance number is dimensionless (a
percentage), regardless of unit_label.

Single source of truth: every Pass/Fail decision in the app should call
compute_pass_fail() below rather than re-deriving a band inline, so this
policy only ever lives in one place. Just as importantly, nothing should
persist a Pass/Fail verdict and trust it forever - a stored value only
ever reflects the tolerance rule in effect at the moment it was written,
so every screen that reports a pass rate or an Achieved/Not-achieved
verdict must call compute_pass_fail() live from target_value/actual_value
at read time (see analytics.property_results_dataframe, app.py's
dashboard KPI, and reports.py's report builders). That is what makes a
tolerance correction here take effect everywhere immediately, without a
separate recompute step every time this table changes.
