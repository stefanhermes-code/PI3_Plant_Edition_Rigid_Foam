"""Clones every default role template (admin/technical/viewer, plus any
others the platform owner has added on the Default User Roles page) into a
new company's own copies.

See db.py's Role docstring for why this exists: the templates
(company_id=NULL, is_builtin=True) are never assigned to a User directly and
never shown outside the Default User Roles page. Every real company needs
its own company_id-scoped clone so that one company narrowing a built-in
role's page access can never affect another company.

    real role ids available if needed, but does NOT commit; the caller
