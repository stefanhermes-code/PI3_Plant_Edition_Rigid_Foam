PI3 Plant Edition - v0.1 internal prototype

- Production / Streamlit Cloud: set st.secrets["DATABASE_URL"] to a Supabase
  Postgres connection string (Session pooler, e.g.
  postgresql+psycopg2://postgres:<password>@<host>:5432/postgres).
- Local development: falls back to a local SQLite file (pi3_local.db) if

#
# Multi-tenant access control. A Company is the tenant boundary: it owns a
# subscription (which caps user/plant counts and gates whole feature areas)
# and its own users. Data isolation is "shared database, company_id column"
# rather than one database per customer - plants, raw_materials, and
# suppliers each carry a company_id (everything else already hangs off
# plant_id through the existing hierarchy, so scoping the plant list per
# company scopes everything under it).
#
# Roles are a real table, not a hardcoded list, so the platform owner can
# define any number of default role templates beyond the original three
# (admin/technical/viewer, company_id NULL - cloned into every new company,
# see role_provisioning.py), and a company can define its own custom roles
# on top of its clones.
#
# Per-role, per-page access is a DENY list, not an allow list: a role with
# no RolePagePermission rows has full access to every page (matches every
# role's behavior before this per-page split existed, and needs no rows
# seeded for the common case). Each row can deny in one of two ways:
#   - can_view=False: the page is hidden entirely (nav + direct access).
#   - can_view=True, can_use=False: the page is visible and its data can be
#     read, but its Add/Edit/Delete forms and any action buttons (CSV
#     import, "Ask PI3", approvals, downloads, ...) are hidden - a genuine
#     read-only view, not just a suggestion. can_use=True with no row is
#     the default ("full access"); can_use=True is never combined with
#     can_view=False (using implies being able to view) - the admin UI only
#     ever offers three states (Hidden / View only / Full access) to avoid
#     that nonsensical combination, see access_control.py.
# As of this schema version the MODEL supports view-vs-use everywhere, but
# individual operational pages opting in to actually hiding their own
# write controls when can_use=False is a page-by-page rollout, not yet
# complete for every page - see access_control.py's module docstring for
# which pages currently check it.

# Records one row every time one of analytics.py's three shared, cached
# data-loading functions (run_settings_dataframe, property_results_dataframe,
# actual_usage_dataframe) actually has to hit the database - i.e. a cache
# MISS, not every call. A cache hit never re-executes the function body, so
# it never reaches the logging call either; that's deliberate, not an
# oversight - the whole point of this table is to show how expensive the
# real work is and how often it actually happens, not to log the (much more
# frequent, and near-instant) cache hits too. See analytics._log_performance.
#
# grade_ids stores foam_grade_id as text (comma-joined) rather than a proper
# FK, since that parameter is sometimes a single id and sometimes a list (a
# foam family's pooled grade ids - see analytics._grade_id_list) - this
# table is a lightweight operational log, not a normalized relationship, so
# a denormalized text snapshot is the right amount of structure here.
#
# Logging itself must never be able to break a page: analytics._log_performance
# wraps this insert in a try/except and swallows any failure silently, so a
# logging problem (e.g. this table not yet migrated on some environment)
# degrades to "no data on the Performance admin page", never a crashed

# above (which only covers 3 shared data-loading functions, and only on a

# logged once per Streamlit rerun of ANY page - both a fresh navigation and
# every widget-triggered rerun on that same page, since a rerun re-executes
# the whole page script top to bottom under Streamlit's model. Measured
# around app.py's single pg.run() call (see st.navigation()) - the one
# choke point every page's script runs through - so this fires for every
# page with no change needed to any of the ~27 individual page files.

    Why this exists: get_session() deliberately reuses ONE session per
    browser tab across every rerun (see its docstring), and every read
    (.query()/.get()/...) under SQLAlchemy's default autocommit=False opens
    a transaction. Pages that only display data - Trend Analysis, Recipe
    Optimization, Root-Cause Assistant, Machine Settings vs Physical
    Properties Correlation, Machine Settings Optimization, Demo Data
    Admin, and any read-only view
    of a page that also supports editing - never call session.commit()
    themselves, since they have nothing to save. Without this function,
    that transaction would sit "idle in transaction" - holding read locks
    on every table it queried - until some later rerun happened to submit a
    form, or forever, if the user only browses and then leaves the tab
    open or closes it.

    This is not a theoretical concern: exactly this happened in production
    - a single read-only page view left a transaction open for roughly 18
    hours, holding locks that blocked an unrelated schema migration until
    the stale connection was manually terminated.

    Safe to call unconditionally after every rerun: every place in this app
    that adds/edits/deletes already calls session.commit() itself within
    the same rerun the change happens in (see cascades.py's docstring - a
    whole master-data delete is deliberately one all-or-nothing
    transaction, committed once by the caller). So by the time this runs,
    there is never a "half-finished" change sitting uncommitted - this only
    ever closes out a transaction that was already left in a fully
