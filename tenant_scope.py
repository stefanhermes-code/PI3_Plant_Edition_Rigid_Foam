"""Shared company-scoping helpers for the operational pages that sit below
Plant in the schema hierarchy.

Plant, RawMaterial, and Supplier already carry their own `company_id`
(see pages/1_Plant_Installation_Overview.py and pages/14_Raw_Materials.py).
Everything else - product families, foam grades, recipes, production runs,
and all the quality/trial data keyed to a production run or a plant - has
no `company_id` column of its own. It scopes through the plant(s) it
ultimately hangs off:

    Plant --- ProductFamily --- FoamGrade --- RecipeVersion --- RecipeComponent
      |
      +--- Machine
      |
      +--- ProductionRun --- QualityObservation / PhysicalPropertyResult /
                              ExpertNote / ...
      |
      +--- CustomerTrial --- Sample / QualityObservation / PhysicalPropertyResult
      |     (independent lab-trial flow, no ProductionRun underneath)
      |
      +--- OptimizationTrial --- Sample / QualityObservation / PhysicalPropertyResult
      |     (independent lab-trial flow, no ProductionRun underneath)
      |
      +--- PI3AIConnectionSetting

`None` is used throughout as the "unfiltered" sentinel (the platform owner
viewing "All companies"), matching the convention already used in
access_control.py and on the Plant/Raw Materials pages. An empty list
(`[]`) is a real, different value: it means the company has zero plants
(or zero families, etc.) yet, so anything scoped to it should show nothing
- not silently fall through to "everything."

# Plant/ProductFamily/FoamGrade/ProductionRun/CustomerTrial/
# OptimizationTrial rows (the six models these helpers resolve) is handled
# by those pages calling clear_scope_cache() immediately after their own

    The selectbox only renders when is_platform_owner AND there is more

    actual production state, and likely the common case for a while),
    a "Company: All companies" vs "Company: <the only company>" choice
    is pure noise - there's nothing to actually choose between, and the
    scoped result set is identical either way - so it was showing on
    every operational and analysis page for no reason (see
    PI3_Gaps_and_Ambiguities.docx-style feedback: a platform-owner user
    kept seeing this dropdown and asked why, since analysis is always
    done within one company's data). Locking to that one company (rather
    than leaving it as the unscoped None sentinel) keeps downstream
    scoping semantics identical to the non-platform-owner path, so
    nothing downstream needs to special-case "exactly one company." As
    soon as a second company is created, the selectbox reappears
